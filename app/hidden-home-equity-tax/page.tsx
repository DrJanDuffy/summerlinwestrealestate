          If you own a home in Summerlin West, you’ve made a smart investment. Over the past decade, our community has seen remarkable growth, with property values soaring and neighborhoods flourishing. As a homeowner, you’ve likely built substantial equity—an achievement worth celebrating. But before you consider selling, there’s a crucial financial detail that could dramatically impact your bottom line, and many long-term residents are unaware of it.

          <h2>The Core Problem: An Outdated Tax Law That Could Cost You</h2>
          <p>
            Here’s what every homeowner needs to know: the federal capital gains tax law for home sales was created in 1997. Under this law, individuals can exclude up to <strong>$250,000</strong> of profit from the sale of their primary residence, while married couples filing jointly can exclude up to <strong>$500,000</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here’s the catch: since 1997, national home prices have skyrocketed by over <strong>260%</strong>, yet these exemption limits have never been adjusted for inflation or rising property values. As a result, more and more homeowners are finding themselves exposed to a significant tax bill—one that was never intended for ordinary families.

          <h2>The Local Impact: Why Summerlin West is Uniquely Affected</h2>
          <p>
            This isn’t just a national issue—it’s hitting close to home. According to the National Association of Realtors®, <strong>43%</strong> of homeowners in Nevada have accumulated more equity than the federal exemption allows. In a high-appreciation area like Summerlin West, that percentage is likely even higher.
          </p>
          <p>
            The very success of our local market—the same appreciation that has built your wealth—could now trigger a substantial and unexpected tax liability when you sell. This is the <strong>“hidden home equity tax”</strong>: a consequence of your home’s impressive performance outpacing an outdated, stagnant law.
